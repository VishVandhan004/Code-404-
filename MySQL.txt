MySQL is a programming language used to create databases.. it is very much helpful in creating databases..

SQL - Structured query language.

Instagram, Netflix, Airbnb, microsoft use SQL as their databases

if we are playing around with big amounts of data like creating the database, managing it, etc, we can consider SQL..

Data is in the form of tables and columns..

Database -  it's a collection of data that are stored together. data stored should be similar. you can't store data of students and teachers together. keep students and teachers separate.

Data can be written on a paper, stored in excel or stored using softwares like SQL..

2 Types of databases: relational and non-relational
relational- data is characterized into rows and columns. ex- SQL.
non relational- data is charcaterized into graphs but not in rows and columns.
relational database uses RDBMS..

Key - used to allow the arrangement of different tables in database.. we can access all the details of a particular data easily using keys.
exp->  for student , student_id, student_name, student_rollno, student_age, etc are some of the keys.

primary key - it's the most important key in database. it can only be one and no duplication and no null value
ex-> student_id can be the primary key..

unique key - it must have unique values

super key- set of multiple keys used to identify data.
exp-> student_id and student_name -> will have same name but not same id..

alternate key- it can be an alternate for the primary key. must be a unique value like ID.
exp-> student_email can work as an alternate.

Candidate key- set of columns which has keys that can replace the primary key. it's somewhat similar to alternate key.
exp-> student_email and student_phoneno are examples
