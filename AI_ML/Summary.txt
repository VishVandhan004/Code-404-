We should be using the jupyter notebooks for the implementation of all the Data-science and machine learning projects.

Numpy -> numpy is a python library which is used for quick mathematical operations like mean, standard deviation, median, etc.
it is used for working with arrays. It stands for numerical python. It is basically 50x faster than the normal python lists.

Pandas -> Pandas are used for data cleaning and preprocessing tasks before data modeling. Very important for Data-Science.

Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for data visualization
